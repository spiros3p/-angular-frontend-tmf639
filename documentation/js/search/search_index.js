Engineering of the University of Patras (UoP).Its purpose is to serve a front-end application that communicates, through a protected Reverse-proxy server, with a Web Service that manages gNodeB (5G antennas) using the TMF639 API model.For that a reason the present Angular application (/frontend) along with the present Nodejs (/backend) for authorization and reverse-proxy have been developed.The below infographic represents the whole system and the green bordered boxes address the applications developed for the purpose of the thesis.\n\nThe present repository consists of 2 submodules (repositories)\n\nan Angular Frontend application found here \nand a NodeJS - Express backend application found here\nin order to have complete functionality, we use the JSON-SERVER for a mock REST API server that serves the resources, since developing that backend application was not part of my work.\n\nInitialization\n\nDownload/clone the repository on your local system using the flag --recursive (to download the content of both submodules)git clone --recursive https://github.com/spiros3p/Radio-Management-Server-thesis.git\n\nPrerequisites\n\nHave Node.js and NPM installed on your system.\nHave Angular (12.2.7) installed on your system: npm install -g @angular/cli@12.2.7\n(Optional) Have Docker installed on your system.\n\nManual Setup\nAngular app - Frontend\n\nNavigate to ./frontend directory\nRUN npm install\nEdit file ./frontend/src/app/router/app-routing.module.tsby commenting out the desired block of code that defines the const appRoutescanActivate: [AuthGuard] protects the routes using  ./backend server of this project.\n(Optional) RUN npm run server on ./frontend directory\n\nStarts a local JSON-SERVER (fake RestAPI) at port 5000 that serves your TMF639 specification based Resources.     \n\nEdit ./frontend/package.json - line 10 to change port or uninstall the module.\n./frontend/json-server/db.json file contains the dummy Resources that are being served.\n\n\nEdit files \nFor Development build ./frontend/src/environments/environment.ts \nFor Production build ./frontend/src/environments/environment.prod.ts    \nDefine the following variables according to your own servers and ports that RUN the server for the Resources (here JSON-SERVER port 5000) and the server for the user Authorization/reverse-proxy (here the nodejs server in the ./backend directory at port 3000).\nYou can still use direct connection between the Front end and the Web Service serving the Resources by filling the apiURL variable or leaving it empty for the Reverse-Proxy to do the job.\n\n\n\n\nStart the Angular application on the ./frontend directory  \nFor Development RUN ng serve \nFor Production RUN ng build (compiles the angular app) and drop your build into your own production server\n\n\nAngular app is ready and running at http://localhost:4200/\nif you chose to use the canActivate: [AuthGuard] routes, at step  3., you landed at a login page and you have to move to step 8. to continue setup.\nif you chose to NOT use the canActivate: [AuthGuard] routes you are DONENodejs app (authorization/user restAPI) - Backend\n\n\n\nNavigate to ./backend directory\nRUN npm install (you may need to RUN npm install bcrypt separately in some occasions)\nRENAME ./backend/.env-example file to ./backend/.env\nEDIT the same ./backend/.env file     \nDefine your existing MySQL database connection settings (if you dont have one see the docker setup of the project further below to setup one).\nDefine SESSION_SECRET to protect the sessions created by PassportJS in the present Express NodeJS app.\nDefine FRONT_END_IP as the IP and Port where the Angular app - frontend is running (this is needed to allow the certain IP to exchange cookies between the nodeJS app and the Angular app)\n\n\nNavigate to your MySQL db (own or see docker setup to use one) and copy the table ./backend/db/tbl_users.sql inside the MySQL Database defined at DB_DATABASE previously.     \nStart the NodeJS application on the ./backend directory (Runs at Port 3000) \nFor Development RUN npm run watch (to run the app with Nodemon. This will restart the app at every save.) \nFor Production RUN node app.js\n\n\nVoila! You can navigate to http://localhost:4200/ and login with the existing users (admin and test - found in the table file you copied at step 12.) or create a new one\n\nSetup using Docker (docker-compose)\nUsing docker to run the app will start 5 different containers\n\nAngular app running at port 4200\nJSON-SERVER (mock Resources server API) running at port 5000\nNodeJS app (auth/user/reverse-proxy API) running at port 3000\nMySQL database running at defualt port 3306\nphpMyAdmin app running at port 5001\n\nYou can edit files and comment out any application you dont want the docker to run:\n\nFor Development build ./docker-compose.yml \nFor Production build ./docker-compose.prod.yml\n\n\nRENAME ./.env-example file to ./.env\nEDIT the same ./.env file (like previously at step 11.)\nDefault DB is using root user - MySQL Docker image is not creating another one.\nDefine everything like before (these variables will be used in the mysql docker image to setup the database and also in the nodejs app to connect to the db)\nFRONT_END_IP depends on whether you are running it on your local machine or remote server. In the case of a remote server you need to use the external IP of the machine.\nPROXY_IP is used in the NodeJS application to target the Web Service that serves the resources. Even at development you may need to use the network's IP of your machine to target the application correctly.\n\n\nSame like step 3. before at manual setup\nSame like step 5. before at manual setup\nRUN the docker-compose file in the root directory:     \nFor Development RUN docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d\nFor Production RUN docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d\n\n\nMake sure you navigate to http://localhost:5001/ and copy the table ./backend/db/tbl_users.sql inside the running MySQL application defined DB_DATABASE\nVoila! The full application is app and running at http://localhost:4200/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2022 Spiros P\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
